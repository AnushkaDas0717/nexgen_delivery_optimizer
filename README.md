## Project Overview
NexGen Logistics faces challenges such as delivery delays, rising costs, and lack of predictive intelligence.  
**NexGen Delivery Optimizer** is a data-driven analytics and ML platform that predicts delivery delays **before they occur**, provides **actionable insights**, and recommends **optimal operational decisions** in real-time.

The solution helps NexGen move from **reactive** to **predictive** operations, improving **efficiency, cost control, and customer satisfaction.**

##  Components & Functionality

### 1. **Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessing.py`)**
- Loads and cleans all datasets (handles missing values, duplicates)
- Merges six CSVs into a unified logistics dataset  
- Engineers new features (e.g., delay flags, cost ratios)
- Computes KPIs such as:
  - On-Time Delivery Rate
  - Average Delay
  - Customer Ratings
  - Average Cost per Delivery



### 2. **Model Training (`model_training.py`)**
- Uses **Gradient Boosting Classifier** for predicting delivery delays  
  *(chosen over Random Forest for better performance on small, imbalanced datasets)*
- Includes:
  - Train/test split and feature scaling  
  - Model accuracy, ROC-AUC, and feature importance  
  - Confusion matrix and detailed classification report  
- Integrates a **Rule-Based Recommendation Engine** that:
  - Suggests delivery strategies based on delay probability
  - Optimizes vehicle selection and carrier choice
  - Advises on operational adjustments (route, buffer, express upgrade)



### 3. **Visual Analytics (`visuals.py`)**
- Dynamic and interactive visualizations:
  - KPIs and metric cards  
  - Delay analysis by priority  
  - Cost vs Delay scatter plots  
  - Carrier performance heatmaps  
  - Customer ratings and feedback word clouds  
  - Weather and distance impact plots  
  - Feature importance charts  



### 4. **Streamlit App (`app.py`)**
#### **Main Sections:**
1. **üìä Overview Dashboard**
   - Real-time KPIs and visual summaries  
   - Priority-based delay trends  
   - Carrier comparison and cost distribution  

2. **üîÆ Predict Delay**
   - User form for new order parameters  
   - Real-time prediction with probability output  
   - Smart recommendations and risk insights  
   - Vehicle optimization suggestions  

3. **üìà Insights & Analytics**
   - Feature analysis and model insights  
   - Weather and route impact trends  
   - Cost breakdown by priority and type  
   - Customer feedback visualization

##  Innovation Highlights

###  Predictive Intelligence
- Uses ML to proactively forecast delivery risks instead of reacting post-failure.

###  Recommendation Engine
- Rule-based AI logic that generates **real-time operational suggestions** based on predicted risk, distance, and priority.

###  Cost Intelligence
- Merges cost breakdown and performance data to identify **optimization opportunities** (e.g., high fuel cost carriers, low efficiency routes).

###  Fleet & Route Optimization
- Suggests ideal vehicle types based on delivery type, distance, and priority.

###  Sustainability Support
- Indirectly reduces emissions and fuel use via smarter routing and fleet decisions.

##  Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | ~47% *(small dataset ‚Äî proof-of-concept)* |
| ROC-AUC | Moderate |
| Insights | Distance, Weather Impact, and Priority are top predictive factors |

**Note:** The dataset provided for the challenge was limited (‚âà200 rows).  
In real-world enterprise deployment with millions of records, the model would achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy due to richer feature diversity.
